## üóÑÔ∏è Database Verification

### Check Data in Supabase

1. **Categories Table**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM categories ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Should show your test category
   - ‚úÖ Check name, description, created_at

2. **Products Table**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Should show your test product
   - ‚úÖ Verify: name, price, stock, image_url, category_id

3. **Orders Table**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Should show your test order
   - ‚úÖ Verify: user_id, status, total_amount (auto-calculated)

4. **Order Items Table**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE order_id = 1;
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Should show all items for the order
   - ‚úÖ Verify: product_id, quantity, price

5. **Join Query (Verify Relationships)**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     o.id as order_id,
     o.total_amount,
     o.status,
     oi.product_id,
     oi.quantity,
     oi.price,
     p.name as product_name
   FROM orders o
   JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
   JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
   WHERE o.id = 1;
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Should show complete order with product details

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot connect to database"
**Solution:**
- Check `.env` file has correct SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
- Verify Supabase project is active
- Check internet connection

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized"
**Solution:**
- Ensure you logged in and token is saved
- Check Authorization header format: `Bearer {token}`
- Token might be expired - login again

### Issue: "403 Forbidden"
**Solution:**
- User trying to access admin endpoint
- Use admin token for admin endpoints
- Check user role in database

### Issue: "Product not found"
**Solution:**
- Use correct product ID from create response
- Product might have been deleted
- Check products table in Supabase

### Issue: "Cannot delete category with existing products"
**Solution:**
- This is expected behavior
- Delete products first, then category
- Or use CASCADE in database (not recommended)

## üìù Notes

- Test data is automatically cleaned up by automated test script
- Manual testing data remains in database (delete manually if needed)
- Always test with fresh data to avoid conflicts
- Keep admin credentials secure
- Use different emails for each test run to avoid duplicates
